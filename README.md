## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## 🔄 GitHub Actions Workflow

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds the project and deploys it to an FTP server when changes are pushed to the main branch.

### Setting up the GitHub Secrets

For security reasons, the FTP connection details are not hardcoded in the workflow file. Instead, they use GitHub secrets. To set up these secrets:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
3. Click on "New repository secret"
4. Set up the following secrets:
   - Name: `ovh_url`
     Value: Enter your FTP server URL
   - Name: `ovh_user`
     Value: Enter your FTP username
   - Name: `ovh_password`
     Value: Enter your FTP password
5. Click "Add secret" for each

### FTP Deployment Configuration

The workflow is configured to deploy to an FTP server using the following environment variables:
- FTP Server: Stored in the `ovh_url` secret
- Username: Stored in the `ovh_user` secret
- Password: Stored in the `ovh_password` secret
- Directory: The root directory of your FTP server

You can modify these settings in the `.github/workflows/publish-prod.yml` file.
